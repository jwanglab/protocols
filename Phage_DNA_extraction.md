Phage HMW (full-length) DNA extraction and purification
-------------------------------------------------------

#### Materials

* DNase I Buffer (10x)
  * 100 mM Tris, pH 7.5
  * 25 mM MgCl2
  * 5 mM CaCl2
* SDS 10%
* Proteinase K (stock 20 mg/ml)
* DNase I (Ambion 2U/µl)
* NaCl 5M
* NaCl (crystal)
* PEG 8000 (crystal)
* Freshly prepared 70% EtOH
* Nuclease-free water

#### Culture lysis
1. Grow bacterial culture overnight in LB from a colony
2. Transfer 100mL to 400mL of fresh LB
3. Add in 100µL of T7 (8.85 x 10^7 pfu/mL)
4. Incubate at 37C with shaking for 8 hours

#### Phage precipitation
1. Remove a 50mL aliquot from the phage culture
  * 1ml of lysate with a titer of 1e10 contains ~500ng of phage DNA, assuming a genome size of 50kb
2. Add NaCl to a final concentration of 1M (2.92g for a 50mL lysate) and dissolve by swirling 
3. Add PEG 8000 to a final concentration of 10% (w/v in g/mL; 5g for a 50mL lysate) and dissolve by stirring at room temperature
4. Incubate mixture on ice for 1 hour
5. Centrifuge the mixture at 4000g for 25 min at 4C
6. Discard the supernatant without disturbing the pellet-side of the tube
  * It's not so much a pellet as a faint smear all down the side of the tube
7. Gently resuspend the pellet 500µl nuclease-free water. Wash the walls of the tube thoroughly in the process
8. Centrifuge the suspension at 3000g for 15 min at 4C
9. Transfer the supernatant to a 1.5ml microfuge tube

#### DNA purification 
1. Add 55µl 10x DNase I buffer and 2µl DNase I, mix by inversion
2. Incubate at 37C for 10 minutes
3. Add 11µl of 0.5M EDTA (to a final concentration of ~10 mM), mix by inversion
4. Incubate (heat inactivate DNase) at 75°C for 10 min
5. Add 10µl 5M NaCl (to a final concentration of ~0.1M)
6. Add 125µl SDS (to a final concentration of ~2%)
7. Add 10µl Proteinase K (to a final concentration of ~300µg/ml)
8. Incubate at 56-65C for 60 minutes

#### Cleanup
1. Add 400µl resuspended Ampure XP beads
2. Mix by inversion (or on rotator) for 5 min
3. Pellet beads on magnet until clear and colorless
4. Without disturbing the pellet (or smear), add 700µl 70% EtOH and incubate for 30s
5. Remove EtOH without disturbing the beads
6. Repeat 4-5
7. Briefly spin down, replace on magnet, and remove any residual EtOH
8. Allow to dry briefly (a couple of minutes)
9. Resuspend beads by pipetting with 50µl nuclease-free water
10. Incubate at room temperature for 2 min
11. Pellet beads on magnet until clear and colorless
12. Remove supernatant to a fresh 1.5ml tube. This is your clean DNA!
