Phage HMW (full-length) DNA extraction and purification
-------------------------------------------------------

#### Materials

* 10X DNase I Buffer
  * 100 mM Tris, pH 7.5
  * 25 mM MgCl2
  * 5 mM CaCl2
* SDS 10%
* Proteinase K (stock 20 mg/ml)
* DNase I (Ambion 2U/µl)
* NaCl (crystal)
* PEG 8000 (crystal)

#### Culture lysis
1. Grow bacterial culture overnight in LB from a colony
2. Transfer 100mL to 400mL of fresh LB
3. Add in 100µL of T7 (8.85 x 10^7 pfu/mL)
4. Incubate at 37C with shaking for 8 hours

#### Phage precipitation
1. Remove a 50mL aliquot from the phage culture
2. Add NaCl to a final concentration of 1M (2.92g for a 50mL lysate) and dissolve by swirling 
3. Add PEG 8000 to a final concentration of 10% (w/v in g/mL; 5g for a 50mL lysate) and dissolve by stirring at room temperature
4. Incubate mixture on ice for 1 hour
5. Centrifuge the mixture at 4000g for 25 min at 4C
6. Discard the supernatant. Tilt the container to allow excess liquid to drain away from the pellet
7. Gently resuspend the pellet 500µl of nuclease-free water (or 1x DNase I buffer). Wash the walls of the container thoroughly in the process
8. Centrifuge the suspension at 3000g for 15 min at 4C
9. Transfer the supernatant to a 1.5ml microfuge tube

#### DNA purification 
1. Add 55µl 10X DNase I buffer, 5µl DNase I (2U/µl), and 2µl RNase A (10mg/ml)
2. Incubate at 37C for 10 minutes
3. Add 10µl of 0.5M EDTA (to a final concentration of 10 mM)
4. Heat inactivate at 75°C for 10 minutes
5. Add 10µl 5M NaCl (to a final concentration of 0.1M)
6. Add 150µl SDS (to a final concentration of ~2%) and 10µl Proteinase K (to a final concentration of ~300µg/ml)
7. Incubate at 56C for 60 minutes, inverting to mix occasionally

#### Cleanup
1. Any column or SPRI bead cleanup, verbatim, but avoid vortexing
2. Elute into 50µl nuclease-free water
